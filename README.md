# AdventOfCode_2021
Solutions to Advent of Code 2021

## Usage
Install with pip, or however you prefer.

The functions to solve just require the raw input string from Advent of Code, but there
are helpers to download the inputs automatically.

Use `from advent2021.helpers import get_day` and/or follow along in `run_days.py`.

You'll need a text file with only the session id from your Advent of Code cookies
and a folder to save inputs to.

## Contributions
Send up an issue or a PR if you see an improvement to make or to just talk about other solution possibilites.

Advent of Code is for fun and enrichment!
